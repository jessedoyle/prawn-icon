Prawn::Icon provides a simple mechanism for rendering icons and icon fonts from within [Prawn](https://github.com/prawnpdf/prawn).

The following icon fonts ship with Prawn::Icon:

* FontAwesome (http://fontawesome.io/icons/)
* Material Design Icons (https://materialdesignicons.com/)
* Foundation Icons (http://zurb.com/playground/foundation-icon-fonts-3)
* PaymentFont (https://paymentfont.com)

Prawn::Icon was originally written by Jesse Doyle.

## Installation

Prawn::Icon is distributed via RubyGems. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
gem install prawn-icon
```

## Usage

Prawn::Icon was designed to have an API familiar to Prawn. A single icon may be rendered as such:

```ruby
require 'prawn/icon'

Prawn::Document.generate('icons.pdf') do |pdf|
  pdf.icon 'fas-beer', size: 60
end
```

produces:

![FontAwesome Beer](https://raw.github.com/jessedoyle/prawn-icon/master/examples/fas-beer.png)

## Inline Icons

You can also provide the `inline_format: true` option to Prawn::Icon:

```ruby
require 'prawn/icon'

Prawn::Document.generate('inline_icons.pdf') do |pdf|
  pdf.icon 'Enjoy: <icon size="20" color="AAAAAA">fas-beer</icon>', inline_format: true
end
```

produces:

![FontAwesome Beer Inline](https://raw.github.com/jessedoyle/prawn-icon/master/examples/fas-beer-inline.png)

When using `inline_format: true`, you may supply `<icon>` tags with `color` and `size` attributes.

## Use with [Prawn::Table](https://github.com/prawnpdf/prawn-table)

A `table_icon` method may be called when creating a table's data array to render icons within a table cell:

```ruby
require 'prawn/icon'
require 'prawn/table'

Prawn::Document.generate('table_icons.pdf') do |pdf|

  data = [
    # Explicit brackets must be used here
    [pdf.table_icon('fas-birthday-cake'), 'Cake'],
    ['is', 'Great!']
  ]

  pdf.table(data) # => (2 x 2 table)
end
```

Note that the `table_icon` method supports the `inline_format: true` option to create multiple icons within a cell.

## Specifying Icon Families

Prawn::Icon uses the prefix of an icon key to determine which font family is used to render a particular icon.

Currently supported prefixes include:

* `fab` - [FontAwesome Brands](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&s=brands&m=free) (eg. `fab-amazon`).
* `far` - [FontAwesome Regular](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&s=regular&m=free) (eg. `far-address-book`).
* `fas` - [FontAwesome Solid](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&s=solid&m=free) (eg. `fas-location-arrow`).
* `mdi` - [Material Design Icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/) (eg. `mdi-beer`),
* `fi` - [Foundation Icons](https://zurb.com/playground/foundation-icon-fonts-3) (eg. `fi-compass`).
* `pf` - [PaymentFont](https://paymentfont.com/#icons) (eg. `pf-cash`).

## How It Works

Prawn::Icon uses a "legend" to map icon keys to unicode characters that respresent a particular icon within the font file.

This legend is a standard `.yml` file located within the font's directory.

If you wish to fork this repository and add a new font, you'll likely need to supply a corresponding legend file. Please see the current legend files within the `data/fonts` directory for examples.

## Examples

A Rake task is included to generate documents that display each icon and it's corresponding icon key.

The command:

```bash
rake legend
```

should generate these files when run from Prawn::Icon's gem directory.

## Configuration

You can optionally configure Prawn::Icon to use an alternate data directory for font files.

```ruby
Prawn::Icon.configure do |config|
  config.font_directory = '/path/to/my/fonts'
end
```

## Contributing

I'll gladly accept pull requests that are well tested for any bug found in Prawn::Icon.

If there is enough demand for including a particular icon font, I will also accept a pull request to include it in Prawn::Icon.
